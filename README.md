    I assume most of you know Conway's Game of Life -- a simple set of rules
    over a square digital grid that shows intriguing evolution and self-organization.
    Each cell's lifecycle is determined by its four or eight neighbours -- depending on the implementation.

    Now I figured that a hexagonal grid would be the most natural way to implement this.
    Why? Because in hexagonal coordinates, there is no ambiguity between the number of
    possible neighbors -- each cell is perfectly surrounded by exactly six neighbors.

    The results are quite trippy. :)
